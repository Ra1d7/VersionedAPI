# VersionedAPI
Demo code for an API with multiple versions with swagger configured to work in a multi-versioned enviroment

This C# .NET Core API demonstrates how to configure APIs to be multi-versioned using ASP.NET Core versioning middleware and how to configure Swagger to work with multiple versions of the API. The API provides multiple versions of the same endpoint, each with different options. The ASP.NET Core versioning middleware allows for serving multiple versions of an endpoint from a single controller. The API also provides a Swagger UI that documents all the API endpoints and their parameters. The Swagger UI is configured to work with multiple API versions, allowing for easy access to documentation for each version. With this API, you can easily create and manage multiple versions of your API while maintaining a clear and concise documentation.
